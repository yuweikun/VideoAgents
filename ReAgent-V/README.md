# 📌 Overview
![Framework Overview](assets/framework.png)  


## 🚀 Applications

ReAgent-V supports a range of real-world tasks via dedicated application modules:

### 🧭 VLA Alignment  
Aligns **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models using **Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO)** guided by ReAgent-V’s reward feedback. Specifically, ReAgent-V evaluates each trajectory across multiple axes—such as task success, temporal stability, visual grounding, and semantic precision—and performs multi-agent reflection to produce refined, high-fidelity reward scores for alignment.

- 📘 Instructions: [VLA Alignment README](https://github.com/aiming-lab/ReAgent-V/blob/main/Application/VLA-Alignment/README.md)

### 🎥 Video Understanding 

- **Entropy-Calibrated Frame Selection**  
  Efficiently selects the most informative frames for video reasoning.

- **Tool-Augmented Inference**  
  Dynamically integrates multimodal tools including OCR, ASR, object detection, scene graph generation, and captioning, etc.

- **Multi-Agent Reflection**  
  Iteratively refines outputs by encouraging disagreement and consensus among diverse agent personas (conservative / neutral / aggressive).

### 📈 Reward-Aware Data Curation and Collection for SFT, DPO, GRPO, and Beyond

ReAgent-V enables **inference-time data curation** by leveraging real-time rewards and reflection-based diagnostics depending on the optimization paradigm, the extraction strategy varies:


#### 🧪 For **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**

ReAgent-V can directly **collect samples with high reward scores** (from the evaluation report) without requiring additional reflection.

* ✅ These samples indicate that the model’s initial reasoning is reliable.
* 📥 Stored as supervised training pairs with accompanying scalar reward labels from the critic agent.

> Simple, scalable, and label-efficient: reward scores enable dynamic filtering without manual annotation.


#### 🔄 For **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

To curate high-value training data for GRPO, ReAgent-V employs a **reflection-triggering mechanism** grounded in **importance scoring**, effectively identifying **challenging yet informative** video-text samples during the *video understanding phase*.

* 🎥 Each input is a **(video, text) pair**, typically comprising a video and its initial response.
* 📊 During inference, ReAgent-V computes an **importance score** (denoted as `E.importance_score`) based on the critic agent’s **overall assessment of reasoning sufficiency**.
* ❗ If this importance score falls **below a threshold** (e.g., `< 5 out of 10`), the sample is considered **difficult**, meaning the model struggled with initial reasoning and likely required further refinement.
* 📥 The resulting **(video, text)** samples are labeled as **reflection-worthy** and collected as **valuable candidates** for GRPO training.


#### ⚖️ For **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**

ReAgent-V supports **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** by reframing itself from a video reasoning agent into a **reward-generating agent**. This is achieved through a **task template modification** that emphasizes **evaluating answer quality** rather than producing a single correct answer.

* 🧠 Transforms the task from “answer the video question” into **“score the video from different perspectives”** based on visual evidence.

* ♻️ Uses multi-perspective reflection outputs (e.g., **conservative**, **neutral**, **aggressive**) to generate **candidate rewards**.

* 📊 Each candidate reward is generated along **customizable reward dimensions**, such as:

  * 🎯 Visual alignment
  * ⏱️ Temporal accuracy
  * 💬 Linguistic precision
  * 🧠 Reasoning specificity
  * 🔍 Option disambiguation

* ✅ The system identifies the answer with the **higher reflection reward** as the preferred choice.

* 🔗 Constructs (preferred, rejected) pairs from these outputs to serve as **DPO training data**.

> Unlike static or hand-crafted rewards, ReAgent-V’s feedback is **context-aware, multi-dimensional, and fully dynamic**, adapting to each video-question instance.

> 🌀 **Unified Insight**:
> ReAgent-V closes the data curation loop. Its multi-agent reward pipeline not only improves current inference but **continuously supplies high-fidelity data** for future optimization—making learning systems **self-refining** in the wild.
