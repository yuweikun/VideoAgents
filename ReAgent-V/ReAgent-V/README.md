---

## 🎬 Example: `run_pipeline.py` Walkthrough

ReAgent-V’s inference script demonstrates a fully modular and highly adaptable architecture. Below is a breakdown of its flexible components:

---

### 🔗 1. Load Models — *Plug-and-Play VLLMs*

```python
qa_system = ReAgentV.load_default(path_dict)
```

* Easily switch between LLaVA, Qwen, Vicuna, or any VLLM model.
* Paths are defined in `path_dict` and support HuggingFace snapshot-style loading.

---

### 🎞️ 2. Frame Sampling — *ECRS Based Selection*

```python
frames, key_frames, ... = qa_system.load_and_sample_video(question, video_path)
```

* Sampling adapts to the question (e.g., relevance-based, entropy-based).
* Supports customization of sampling strategy and max frame count.

---

### 🛠️ 3. Visual Tool Invocation — *Extensive and Dynamic Tool Use*

```python
modal_info, ..., USE_OCR, USE_ASR, USE_DET = qa_system.retrieve_modal_info(...)
```

ReAgent-V is designed with extensibility in mind:
**Adding new tools is as simple as listing the models and defining when & how they should be used.**

**Workflow:**

1. **List available models** for tool use (e.g., OCR, ASR, Scene Graph, Captioning, etc.)
2. **Dynamically select tools** at runtime based on the input question or system prompt
3. **Load tool-specific models** only when selected (lazy loading supported)
4. **Call tool modules** to extract relevant information (text, objects, audio, graphs...)
5. **Inject results into the multimodal prompt** via template composition

```python
# Example: dynamically select and use **part of the mentioned tools**
if "OCR" in selected_tools:
    ocr_result = run_ocr_model(...)
if "ASR" in selected_tools:
    asr_result = run_asr_model(...)
if "Scene Graph" in selected_tools:
    graph_result = run_scene_graph_model(...)

# Build the prompt with available tool outputs
prompt = build_multimodal_prompt(
    question=question,
    ocr=ocr_result,
    asr=asr_result,
    scene_graph=graph_result,
    ...
)
```

> ✅ This modular design makes it easy to plug in **any vision or language model**, route decisions through LLMs, and construct **task-aware prompts** using only the necessary tools.

---

### 🧩 4. Prompt Construction — *Compositional Prompt Templates*

```python
qs = qa_system.build_multimodal_prompt(...)
```

* Combines the **original question** with outputs from multiple sources:

  * 📝 OCR-extracted text
  * 🔊 ASR transcripts
  * 🧱 Object Detection and Scene Graph outputs
  * 🖼️ Other visual tools (e.g., captioning, layout analysis, retrieval cues)

* Prompt templates are fully **modular** and can be tailored to diverse tasks, including:

  * 🧠 Reasoning and inference
  * 🎬 Video captioning and narration
  * ❓ Multimodal question answering
  * 🎯 Reward modeling and training signal generation

> 🔄 Only relevant tools are incorporated based on task and context, enabling **minimal yet informative** prompt construction for efficient inference.

---

### 🧠 5. Inference — *Flexible VLLM Integration* (using `llava_model` as an example)

```python
initial_answer = llava_inference(qs, video_tensor)
```

* Performs inference using a **VLLM backend**, such as `llava_model`
* Accepts the **composed multimodal prompt** and corresponding **video tensor embedding**
* Designed for **backend flexibility** — you can easily swap in other models like **Qwen**, **Vicuna**, or any custom LLM API

> 🔄 The inference interface is fully decoupled, allowing seamless integration with local, server-based, or cloud-hosted LLMs—no need to modify upstream processing logic.


---

### 🔄 6. Tool Re-selection via Critical Questions

```python
updated_infos = {}
for cq in critique_questions:
    tool_selection_prompt = tool_retrieval_prompt_template.format(question=cq)
    response_list = llava_inference(tool_selection_prompt, video=None)

    USE_ASR = "ASR" in response_list
    USE_OCR = "OCR" in response_list
    USE_DET = "Scene Graph" in response_list

    new_modal_info, new_det_top_idx, _, _, _ = qa_system.retrieve_modal_info(...)
    updated_infos[cq] = new_modal_info
```

This block implements **tool re-selection for each critique question**, enabling *question-specific multimodal retrieval*. Here's how it works:

1. 🧠 **Language-based Tool Selection**
   Each critical question (`cq`) is inserted into a **tool-selection prompt**, which is passed to the LLM (e.g., LLaVA) to decide:

   * Do we need **OCR**?
   * Do we need **ASR**?
   * Do we need **Scene Graph**?

2. ⚙️ **Tool Re-selection & Execution**
   Based on the LLM's response (`response_list`), the pipeline:

   * Sets `USE_OCR`, `USE_ASR`, `USE_DET` flags accordingly
   * **Loads only the selected tools**
   * **Executes them** to extract updated visual/audio/textual signals for the current question

3. 🧩 **Multimodal Context Update**
   The newly extracted tool outputs (`new_modal_info`) are stored in `updated_infos[cq]` for later reflection and evaluation.

```python
context_infos = {question: modal_info, **updated_infos}
```

> ✅ This design allows **fine-grained tool scheduling per question**, driven entirely by the model’s reasoning. Each follow-up question gets **its own dynamic retrieval plan**, making the system both efficient and contextually adaptive.

---

### 📋 7. Evaluation Report — *Structured Feedback as Reward*

```python
eval_report = qa_system.generate_eval_report(...)
```

* Generates a **structured critique** based on:

  * The original question
  * Initial model answer
  * Multimodal context from both the main and critical questions
* Provides a detailed summary of:

  * ✅ Answer strengths
  * ❌ Weaknesses and logical gaps
  * 🔍 Missing visual/audio evidence

> 🔁 This report **closes the reflection loop**, bridging multimodal evidence and LLM reasoning.
> 🎯 It can also serve as a **reward signal** in downstream training via **RLHF**, **DPO**, or **GRPO**, making model updates **aligned with self-critique**.

---

### 🪞 8. Reflective Answer Refinement — *Self-Correction via Multi-Perspective Feedback*

```python
final_answer = qa_system.get_reflective_final_answer(...)
```

* Takes the **initial answer**, the **evaluation report**, and the original **video context**
* Applies **multi-perspective refinement strategies** to improve factuality, coverage, and logic:

  * 🛡️ **Conservative**: Minor surface-level edits
  * ⚖️ **Neutral**: Entity-level consistency and corrections
  * 🔍 **Aggressive**: Structural rethinking with logic and evidence updates

> 🔁 This step completes the **feedback-driven refinement loop**, allowing the model to **self-correct** based on structured critique, retrieved multimodal context, and prior reasoning outputs.
