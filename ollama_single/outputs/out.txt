**Scene Description**  
The driving scenario occurs in a clear urban environment at a road intersection section. After passing the intersection, an accident vehicle appears as an obstacle, reducing passable lanes. Traffic is light with few surrounding vehicles, and the weather is sunny with high visibility. The vehicle transitions from manual to autonomous driving mode (indicator "1") at an unknown point in the sequence.

**Driver's Attention:**  
The driver's visual attention is primarily focused on the road ahead, with moderate focus on system prompts. Key fixations show:  
- **80% of fixations** (72 out of 828.8 seconds) are on "environment" or "dashboard" (100% of points), indicating sustained focus on road conditions and vehicle status.  
- **Critical attention shifts** occur only when approaching an intersection or accident vehicle (e.g., at t=305.112158, t=333.243053, t=500.425521), where the driver fixes on "vehicles" (40% of fixations during these segments).  
- **Rearview mirror fixations** (at t=527.594677 and t=829.140241) confirm the driver checks rear mirror regularly, but shows minimal shift to "vehicles" post-observation.  
- **No fixation points** on "passersby" or "pedestrians" were observed, suggesting the driver prioritizes traffic and vehicle safety over human elements.

**Human-Machine Interaction:**  
The autonomous driving mode shifts to "1" (autonomous) at an arbitrary point, indicating the driver engages the system. The driver maintains grip on the steering wheel with both hands throughout, but does not explicitly "switch mode" after noticing prompts.  
- **Driver actions** align with transition from manual to autonomous mode: The driver is focused on the road ahead while navigating intersections and the obstacle, but does not exhibit overt "preparation takeover" behavior.  
- **Vehicle behavior** remains stable throughout the sequence (0.0-1.0 m/s speeds), with consistent acceleration and steering adjustments.  
- **Driver's prompt**: The system prompts indicate the driver is attentive while monitoring traffic, but shows no "switch" to manual mode after noticing system prompts.  
- **Transition behavior**: After noticing a vehicle (at t=277.943003), the driver remains stable in driving state without any explicit "prepare takeover" action.

**Evaluation & Suggestions:**  
The driver demonstrates stable driving with good focus on the road ahead and system prompts. However, the driver shows **insufficient attention when observing potential hazards** (e.g., accident vehicle) by not taking action to identify or mitigate them. Specifically:  
- **Critical issue**: While the driver maintains focus, they do not proactively check the rearview mirror while near the accident vehicle (e.g., at t=305.112158), which is crucial for safety. The driver is also not taking action to "prepare takeover" when the obstacle is first observed, suggesting they remain stable in manual mode.  
- **Suggested improvements**:  
  1. **Enhance safety awareness**: Focus more on "vehicles" while near intersections and accident vehicles, prioritizing the identification of potential hazards.  
  2. **Proactively check mirror**: After noticing the obstacle, confirm the vehicle's position before initiating any take over.
  3. **Maintain steady speed**: Continue maintaining appropriate speed to avoid dangerous maneuvers.

**Recommended Actions:**  
1. **'Check mirrors'** - **Most critical**: Immediately verify position of the obstacle (e.g., at t=305.112158) to ensure safety and readiness to take over.  
2. **'Continue'** - **Important**: Maintain steady speed during the driving sequence.  
3. **'Prepare takeover'** - **Less critical**: Ready for takeover when the obstacle is first observed.  

**Top 3 Recommendations:**  
1. **'Check mirrors'** (most urgent): Immediately verifies the obstacle's position before taking action to avoid collision.  
2. **'Continue'** (important): Maintain safe speed to prevent dangerous maneuvers.  
3. **'Prepare takeover'** (less urgent): Preparatory action to handle the obstacle before any action is needed.  

**Note**: The driver's action set "Check mirrors" is the highest priority as it directly addresses the hazard observed at t=305.112158, whereas "Prepare takeover" is the second most effective action. This recommendation is supported by the driver's visual focus on environment and dashboard during the sequence, which indicates readiness for emergency maneuvers.
